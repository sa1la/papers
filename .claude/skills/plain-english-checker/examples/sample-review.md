## Plain English Review

### Summary

This sentence suffers from multiple plain English issues: excessive capitalization, passive voice with agent deleted, legalese, and multiple negatives. The rewrite reduces word count by 40% while improving clarity.

### Key Findings

#### 1. Excessive Capitalization

**Original**: "NO PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED..."
**Issue**: All caps are difficult to read and bring readers to a standstill. Word shapes disappear, forcing readers to study each letter.
**Recommendation**: "No person has been authorized..." (or better yet, see full rewrite below)

#### 2. Passive Voice with Agent Deleted

**Original**: "NO PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED..."
**Issue**: The passive voice hides who is (or isn't) doing the authorizing. Readers must take extra mental steps to understand.
**Recommendation**: Use active voice to clarify: "We have not authorized anyone..."

#### 3. Legalese and Jargon

**Original**: "CONTAINED OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS"
**Issue**: Technical terms and formal language create distance between writer and reader.
**Recommendation**: "in this document or that we have referred you to"

#### 4. Multiple Negatives

**Original**: "MUST NOT BE RELIED UPON AS HAVING BEEN AUTHORIZED"
**Issue**: Multiple negatives force readers to mentally translate to positive statements.
**Recommendation**: "You should rely only on..." (positive construction)

### Recommended Rewrite

```
You should rely only on the information contained in this document
or that we have referred you to. We have not authorized anyone to
provide you with information that is different.
```

### Why This Is Better

| Aspect         | Before                     | After                           |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Word count     | 40 words                   | 29 words                        |
| Voice          | Passive                    | Active                          |
| Tone           | Legalistic, distant        | Direct, personal                |
| Readability    | Requires multiple readings | Understandable on first reading |
| Capitalization | All caps                   | Sentence case                   |
| Negatives      | Multiple                   | None                            |

### Principles Applied

1. ✅ **Active voice**: "We have not authorized" instead of "has been authorized"
2. ✅ **Personal pronouns**: "You" and "We" create direct communication
3. ✅ **Shorter sentences**: One long sentence becomes two shorter ones
4. ✅ **Concrete language**: "This document" instead of "JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS"
5. ✅ **Positive construction**: "You should rely only on" instead of "must not be relied upon"
6. ✅ **Removed legalese**: "contained or incorporated by reference" → "contained in this document or that we have referred you to"
