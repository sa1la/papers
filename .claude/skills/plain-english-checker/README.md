# Plain English Checker Skill

A Claude Code skill for reviewing and improving documents based on the SEC's "A Plain English Handbook" principles.

## What This Skill Does

This skill helps you create clearer, more understandable documents by:

- Identifying passive voice, jargon, and legalese
- Flagging long, complex sentences
- Suggesting concrete alternatives to abstract language
- Recommending structural improvements
- Providing specific before/after rewrites

## Installation

1. Copy the `plain-english-checker` folder to your Claude Code skills directory
2. The skill will automatically be available when you start Claude Code

## Usage

Simply ask Claude to check your document for plain English compliance:

```
"Please check this document for plain English issues"
"Review my report using plain English principles"
"Is this writing clear and understandable?"
"Help me rewrite this in plain English"
```

You can provide the document:

- By pasting the text directly
- By referencing a file path
- By sharing a document you've already opened

## Plain English Principles Applied

This skill is based on the SEC's "A Plain English Handbook" and applies these core principles:

1. **Active Voice** - Use strong verbs and clear subjects
2. **Short Sentences** - Aim for 15-20 words on average
3. **Personal Pronouns** - Use "we" and "you" to create direct communication
4. **Concrete Language** - Replace abstractions with specific examples
5. **Remove Excess Words** - Eliminate superfluous phrases
6. **Positive Construction** - Write "Only X may" instead of "Non-X may not"
7. **Simple Words** - Replace jargon with everyday language
8. **Clear Structure** - Keep subject, verb, and object together
9. **Logical Organization** - Present big picture before details
10. **Readable Design** - Use headers, bullets, and white space effectively

## Example Review Output

When you use this skill, you'll receive a structured review including:

- **Summary** - Overall assessment of readability
- **Key Findings** - Specific issues with location, original text, explanation, and recommended rewrites
- **General Recommendations** - Overarching suggestions for improvement
- **Positive Observations** - What the document does well
