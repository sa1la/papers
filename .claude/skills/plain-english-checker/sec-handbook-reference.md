## The 11 Core Principles

### 1. Use Active Voice with Strong Verbs

- **Principle**: Readers understand active voice more quickly because it follows how we think.
- **Check for**: Forms of "to be" + past tense verb + "by" phrases.
- **Fix**: Convert to active voice with specific, strong verbs.

**Example:**

- Before: "The stock is bought by the investor."
- After: "The investor buys the stock."

### 2. Use Short Sentences

- **Principle**: Long, information-packed sentences are hard to understand.
- **Target**: Aim for 15-20 words average; rarely exceed 30 words.
- **Fix**: Break long sentences into shorter ones; present one idea per sentence.

### 3. Use Personal Pronouns

- **Principle**: Pronouns clarify who the information applies to and create a direct tone.
- **Use**: "we/us/our" (first-person plural) and "you/your" (second-person singular).
- **Benefits**: Clarifies responsibilities, creates engagement, avoids abstractions, shortens sentences.

**Example:**

- Before: "This Summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety..."
- After: "Because this is a summary, it does not contain all the information that may be important to you."

### 4. Bring Abstractions Down to Earth

- **Principle**: Concrete terms create mental images; abstractions don't.
- **Fix**: Use specific examples, especially with hypothetical investors or scenarios.
- **Hierarchy**: Asset → Investment → Security → Equity → Stock → Common stock → One share of IBM common stock

### 5. Omit Superfluous Words

- **Principle**: Remove words that don't add meaning.

**Common replacements:**

| Superfluous | Simpler |
|-------------|---------|
| in order to | to |
| in the event that | if |
| subsequent to | after |
| prior to | before |
| despite the fact that | although |
| because of the fact that | because |

### 6. Write in the Positive

- **Principle**: Positive sentences are shorter and easier to understand.
- **Fix**: Replace negative compounds with single words.

**Examples:**

- "not able" → "unable"
- "not accept" → "reject"
- "not many" → "few"
- "not often" → "rarely"
- "not...unless" → "only if"

### 7. Replace Jargon and Legalese

- **Principle**: Use short, common words instead of industry-specific terms.
- **Fix**: Use simpler synonyms; explain technical terms when first used.

**Examples:**

- "terminate" → "end"
- "elucidate" → "explain"
- "utilize" → "use"
- "aforementioned" → (delete or use "this" or "that")

### 8. Keep Subject, Verb, and Object Close Together

- **Principle**: Natural English word order is subject-verb-object.
- **Fix**: Move interrupting modifiers to separate sentences or sections.

### 9. Use "If-Then" Conditionals

- **Principle**: Conditional statements are clearer when following natural word order.
- **Rules**:
  - One if, one then: Start with if
  - One if, multiple thens: Start with if, tabulate the thens
  - Multiple ifs, one then: Start with then, tabulate the ifs
  - Multiple ifs and thens: Break into multiple sentences or use a table

### 10. Keep Sentence Structure Parallel

- **Principle**: Lists and series should use parallel parts of speech.
- **Fix**: Ensure all items in a list use the same grammatical form.

**Example:**

- Before: "to provide you with liquidity, protection of your investment, and high current income"
- After: "to provide you with liquidity, to protect your investment, and to generate high current income"

### 11. Avoid "Respectively"

- **Principle**: "Respectively" forces readers to reread and match items.
- **Fix**: State relationships explicitly.

**Example:**

- Before: "The Senior Notes and the guarantee...will constitute unsecured senior obligations of the Issuer and Island Holdings, respectively."
- After: "The senior notes are an unsecured senior obligation of the issuer, while the guarantee...is an unsecured senior obligation of Island Holdings."

## Document Design Principles

### Typography

- Use serif fonts (e.g., Times, Garamond) for body text
- Use 10-12 point type size
- Avoid all caps (harder to read)
- Use bold and italics for emphasis, not underlining

### Layout

- Use left-justified, ragged-right text (not fully justified)
- Keep line length to 32-64 characters
- Use generous white space and line spacing
- Keep paragraphs short

### Organization

- Present the big picture before details
- Use descriptive headers and subheaders (avoid "General" or "Background")
- Group related information together
- Use bullet lists for complex material
- Use tables for data that readers need to compare
